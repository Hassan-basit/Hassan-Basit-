# Hi, I'm Basit! 👋
### Offensive Security Engineer | Penetration Tester | VAPT Specialist | QA Tester

Passionate about offensive security, Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT). I systematically identify, validate, and remediate vulnerabilities across web applications, cloud environments, Active Directory networks, and internal systems. My work bridges offensive security, penetration testing, and quality assurance blending creativity, analytical thinking, and precision.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an **Offensive Security Engineer** focused on proactive defense through adversarial simulation and deep vulnerability analysis. My philosophy is simple: **You can't defend what you don't understand.**

I specialize in testing web applications, cloud environments, Active Directory networks, and internal systems to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. I document findings clearly and produce actionable remediation guidance.

## 💡 School Projects (Group Lead)

1. **[CRM System for Small Business]()**  
   Led the design and analysis phase, created the process flow and UI prototype using **Figma**, and focused on requirements specification and system security.

2. **[AI-Based Password Strength Checker]()**  
   Developed an **AI/ML-powered password evaluator** that analyzes password entropy and detects weak patterns. When a password is weak, the system provides intelligent example suggestions to improve strength.

3. **[Design of a Virtual Memory with Paging and Segmentation]()**  
   Implemented memory management in **C**, simulating paging and segmentation to optimize allocation and reduce fragmentation.

4. **[USB Monitoring & Protection Tool (Python)]()**  
   Built a Python-based monitoring function that, when authorized and running in a controlled environment, can detect USB device events and programmatically disable USB access on a specific endpoint to reduce data-exfiltration risk. Documented design decisions, use cases, and safe deployment considerations *(intended for defensive endpoint hardening in lab/managed environments).*
